# Connections: Mentor-Mentee Audio Streaming and Slide Platform 🌟

## Overview 🚀
Connections is a web application prototype designed to address the pressing need for mentorship and skill development among the youth, particularly in Malaysia. It offers a unique platform where mentors and mentees can connect through audio streaming and slide presentations, fostering meaningful interactions and knowledge sharing in real-time.

## Case Study 📚
In response to the rapidly evolving global job market, there is a critical need to equip the youth with the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed in the digital era. However, the current educational system often falls short, leading to a skills gap and hindering employment opportunities. Connections aims to bridge this gap by providing a platform for mentorship and skill development.

## Problem Statement ❗

Without access to mentorship opportunities, mentees may not realize their full potential. Connections prioritizes connecting mentees with knowledgeable mentors to empower young professionals and unlock their full potential.

## Proposed Solutions 💡
Connections facilitates connections between mentors and mentees through online audio room events featuring streaming slides.
